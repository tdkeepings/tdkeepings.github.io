# Consumption by default
(key takeaways at the end)

I am a consumer of content. A lot of content. Most of my ~~spare~~ time is spent watching YouTube videos, playing games, browsing Reddit, listening to podcasts. 

I've been thinking a lot about that recently. 

I don't think consumption is inherently bad, but I do think my "proportion" is totally out of whack. I don't create nearly enough. And chances are, you don't either. 

## I don't have time

While I don't time track quite to the levels that [CGP Grey does](https://youtu.be/jlLUuX2a0Cg?t=133), I do keep an idea on hand of the big chunks of time and where they go. 

So to chop up my week: 
7 days at 16 hours (because 8 hours is sleep) gives me 112 hours. 
112 minus work (call it 35 hours) = 77 hours
77 hours minus hubbub (eating, washing, chores @ 2.5h/d) = 60 hours 
60 hours minus wife time (10h/w) = 50 hours
50 hours minus game time (Saturday, Sunday, 2 evenings a week, 30h/w) = 20 hours. 

The one that jumps out is the 30 hours a week spent playing games, and the other 20 hours left usually gets automatically absorbed into gamer and doom scrolling time too. 

So to think that of the 50 hours I have in the week that aren't sectioned off for The Necessaries, I'm spending the majority staring at the screen and consuming. 

Ask yourself this: if you could design a life for someone else, would you allocate 30-50 hours a week to them playing games, watching YouTube, doom scrolling social media? Probably not. Maybe 6-10, but not 50. 

In fact, I can't honestly put my finger on an hour where I'm actively creating in the week. Is this due to lack of time? 

## Consumption vs creation
While I forget the specific video, one of the kicks I've been on for a while now is absorbing everything [Dr K](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG) has to say about mental health and how that pertains to gaming, social media, the internet, and generally all things "this" (gesturing everywhere). 

A key observation he makes around over consumption (gaming addiction, ADHD driven, social media algorithm doing its thing) is if you pay attention to yourself, you'll realise that 9 times out of 10 when you're done, you're apathetic at best and miserable at worst after watching the 700th reel/short/TikTok video. 

The falloff is _massive_. The first 10 minutes is enjoyable. The last 3 hours rarely is. 

(As an aside, an undercurrent to his advice for most things is paying attention to yourself to see how you really feel, which turns out to be solid advice for _every aspect of your life_. It's why people recommend meditating.)

So what do we do about this? Create more stuff. 

## Private creation 
I don't know about you, but I find my brain locks up at the thought of creating _anything_ because I immediately dive down the monetisation / gains / benefits catastrophe hole and cripple myself against doing stuff before I even have a chance to do the thing.

The internet doesn't help with its hearts and likes and follows and rebeeps and boops. Playing the dopamine slotmachines. These shortcuts are trying to bait you into doing the thing more to better suit the algorithms, not your mental health. 

So I ask you this. Why do you need to share your creations?

And hear the answer from me, because the me of yesteryear will want to hear this. 

You don't. You don't need to share anything. Nobody needs to see anything that you do. You're allowed to create in the privacy of your own space. 

And through that, you're allowed to fail. Gloriously. Nobody will ever know. 

_but what value does creation have if nobody validates my existence by liking, following, subscribing???_

Yeah. Facetiousness aside, I think you already see the problem. Through the machinations of tinternet, you perhaps derive too much validation from the outside world. Creation can help to garner validation from within.

## Creation brings a different type of joy
I often describe snowboarding as a "good kind of pain". Sometimes being up the mountain, when it's cold, windy, cloudy, sweaty, legs aching, back sore, nose running can be a bit of a miserable experience. You're a bit of a state, but you push on. 

You might enjoy the moment. You definitely enjoy the shower, food n drink that night. 

But the memories of it tend to be significantly grander than the events themselves. You remember the feeling of gliding down the mountain as better than it probably was. You're thankful for past you for going through the motions so that future you can bask in the achievement sans present pains. 

Delayed gratification, as it were. 

Creating stuff falls into that same camp for me. 

Sitting down and trying to put pen to paper / plectrum to guitar / brush to canvas can be hard work, but coming out the other side you get this sense of achievement for having done _something_. Alright, the thing you made might suck, and that's ok. The next one might not. The next one might be the best thing you've ever made. The next one, heavens forbid, might surprise you. 

## Your own personal retrospective
There's a process in agile software development called a retrospective, where the team gathers every couple weeks to discuss the goods/bads/needs improvingses. 

I've rarely found retros to be of any use, but I think the concept is solid. You _cannot_ improve without analysis. 

Creating something forces you to have your own retro every time you take a moment to zoom out and look at what you've just made. And I think that is supremely powerful. 

Perhaps to hone your craft: look at the picture you just took. Is the angle any good? What about colour balance? ISO? 

Or to understand yourself better: look at the journal entry you just wrote. Is that an honest representation of your day? Am you hiding something from yourself? Could you be wrong? 

## Hidden messages (aka hippy dippy time)
While I don't particularly believe in ghosts or voodoo or woo woo stuff, I do find myself believing in a subconscious and its ability to try and talk to you on occasion. The "real" you, lurking under the surface. The caveman brain as it were. The thing that cooks up batshit crazy dreams that, for some reason, kind of mean something? Sort of? 

I've been realising more and more of late that I've been listening an awful lot to "front brain" me and have put "caveman" me in the backseat, for at least the last 10 years, if not 15. I don't allow myself to do the "fun" thing or listen to the inner child because it's too expensive, ridiculous, takes too long, takes too much energy, doesn't help my career. What was once a prominent voice in the mix has gone quiet, and I can't say I'm particularly happy with this realisation. 

I want to tap into that a bit more. Let that voice grow a bit, and I've found that letting yourself get taken down the path of creating something helps you to talk to, or witness, that part of yourself more. You'll want to add a character to your story, or a splash of blue to a painting, or simply a journal entry. Give it a go. 

No creator, songwriter, artist or whatever has had a crystal clear piece of inspiration and replicated it with 100% accuracy. This, to me, is front brain fallacy. The imperfection of the process (or even losing the signal by simply trying to convey your idea to another person) will always lead to new strands, interesting ideas, "fluff", and it's in those moments you may strike on something new and interesting. 

I wrote some music for a year in 2019 and there's a particular part where my hand slips on the guitar during the recording, adding this odd little "squeak" to the track. I nearly deleted it to retrack it but after listening to it for a while, I left it in. It felt genuine, sincere, authentic, and certainly added flavour I never intended. It actually feels wrong playing the song _without_ that slip in it now.

Serendipity is the name of the game. 

When does serendipity happen? When you're creating something. 

Do you know when it doesn't? 

## My promise to me 
So my commitment to myself is to consume less. Not much less, because I know me and I'll end up not creating anything at all it if I overcommit, but less nonetheless. 

I am going to create more. What does that look like? Something along the lines of: 

- Creating videos / content online including social media posts that may garner discussion. Shitposting counts, at least for now. because it requires creativity 
- Creating blog posts for my own website, even if I don't bother with SEO / plan on having anyone find them 
- Draw. I've found drawing puts me in a zone similar to programming, and I do enjoy it. Until the iPad runs out of battery because 5 hours have gone by and I haven't eaten yet. 
- Photography. Not really done it, but I imagine the process of going somewhere and actively looking at the world for opportunities to take pictures will make me literally see the world differently 
- Writing up my learnings. I've been learning a lot recently, and would love to capture/condense that into posts that aren't just for me because there's no way someone else wouldn't find it useful 
- Movie reviews. Me and the mrs have a movie night every Monday, and I used to add little ratings and reviews to a sheet and have since let that fall off. I want to bring that back to life as it is fun to look back on

My only metrics for this are gut feel. If doing it makes me feel good then that's enough. I know adding more concrete metrics will make me want to game it. 

I do want to hold myself somewhat accountable though, so what I will do is try and use the weekend as my fallback - if something doesn't come up during the week, I'll sit down on Sunday and make _something_, even if it's just a post about what I've learned recently. 

# Actionable takeaways and questions to ask yourself 
- When was the last time you created anything? 
- I suggest you sit down and figure roughly how you spend your hours. Simply look the demon in the eye. Do what you want with the information you're looking at, just know that you can't navigate without a map.
- Start asking yourself "how do I really feel about this?", and really look for the true answer. If you feel emotion well up quickly when you think of the question, that's a sign you might be lying to yourself. 
- Are you consuming too much? When was the last time you "watched" a one hour YouTube video and cant remember a single word from it?
